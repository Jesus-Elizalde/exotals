    "description": "With up to 600-hp under its hood, the 2022 Nissan GT-R is a powerful and tenacious-handling sports car that earns its nickname of Godzilla. Unfortunately, its formula hasn't changed much since it was introduced in 2009 but the sports cars it competes with have. Inside is where the GT-R's age becomes more apparent, with an outdated design and down-market materials that are shared with lesser Nissan models. The GT-R does have several things going for it though. For one thing, all-wheel drive is standard on every model which helps with handling and gives the car a planted, confident feel. Plus, it's more rare than a Porsche 911, so you'll stand out in traffic or at your next track day.",

    "description": "Some emails are better than others. Case in point, when the Bugatti public relations person asks if you'd like to compare and contrast the Bugatti Chiron Sport against the new Chiron Pur Sport (pronounced pure sport), well folks, that's a pretty good email. Yes, I spent a day driving two cars that between them have 3,000 hp, 32 cylinders, eight turbochargers, 128 valves, 20 radiators, and cost north of $7,800,000. That's $3,757,150 for the exposed blue carbon-fiber Chiron Sport and $3,959,000 for the Jet Grey Pur Sport, so you know. We'll get to the difference between them in good time, but first I'd like to tell you a little story about the first time I drove a Bugatti.",

    "description": "We have Ferdinand Piëch to thank for the Bugatti Veyron. Appointed Volkswagen CEO in 1993, Piëch, was responsible for Volkswagen's acquisition of Bentley, Lamborghini, and Ducati, as well as the rebirth of Bugatti. The Veyron was part of Piëch's mission for Volkswagen to become a world leader, and doing so with such an outrageous vehicle proved largely successful.The idea of a 1,000-hp, million-dollar car was even more ludicrous in the early 2000s as it is today, and the Veyron developed into a car of legend. As an example of opulent excess and engineering wizardry, it elevated beyond the automotive space to become something of a cultural icon. The Veyron's successor, Bugatti's modern Chiron, surpasses its older sibling in nearly every objective measure, but it will never seem quite as special as the house that Piëch built.",

Put more simply, if the Performante is Lambo's Porsche 911 GT3 or McLaren 600LT, the STO is its GT3 RS or 620R. It's an extreme vehicle. The STO will offer roughly equivalent straight-line performance to the Huracán EVO AWD and Performante models but deliver the aerodynamics and lap times of the Super Trofeo racers.

Lamborghini shipped it to Porsche Motorsports (you're likely familiar with their 911 GT3, GT2 RS, and Speedster, among others), which modified and massaged it to crank out 641 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque—numbers our Christian Seabaugh called almost certainly underrated.",

The car's paint is also replaced with a foil wrap, and adds ceramic wheel bearings, titanium brake pads, and backing plates. Inside, the standard upholstery is swapped with non-flammable cloth, has less carpeting, and deletes the glove box. Two paint Liquid Metal exterior schemes in silver or blue shade are also available for $63,000.Despite its performance-minded tuning, the 918 Spyder is a pleasant road car with good ride quality and a well-appointed cabin without the Weissach Package. However, since comfort isn't its primary mission, the car's seats are upright and don't have many adjustments while the steering wheel only telescopes.",

That's quicker than the (gasp) 488 GTB, which Ferrari says can hit 62 mph in 3 seconds flat. Of course, it's also quicker than the standard F12 Berlinetta listed at 3.1 seconds to 62 (or 3.6 seconds to 60 mph in our tests.)",

    "description": "Depending on who you ask, the mighty Ferrari Enzo was Ferrari's first real hypercar—fitting, for a car that carries the weight of its founder's given name. As part of the exclusive pantheon of five halo Ferraris that include the 288 GTO, F40, F50, and later LaFerrari, the Enzo was the highly successful follow-up to the rather unsuccessful F50. For the F50, this success is not measured in monetary values—considering the 349-unit run of the F50 sold out as intended—but the F50 failed to capture the collective imagination with the same voracity as the preceding F40 did, especially under the looming shadow of the contemporary McLaren F1.",

    "description": "The Ferrari LaFerrari provides impeccable performance with light but precise steering, and a responsive chassis. The high-revving V-12, which is a retuned version of the unit found on the F12berlinetta, gives the LaFerrari exceptional acceleration when combined with the electric motor and the quick-shifting dual-clutch transmission. Since this is a performance application of a hybrid powertrain, the LaFerrari doesn't have an electric-only mode and is focused on making the car faster instead of saving fuel. The car's adjustable magnetic suspension enables drivers to choose between different settings including a bumpy road option that improves the LaFerrari's cruising experience.",

You can think of the Pista as the 458 Speciale or the 430 Scuderia of the 488 range. With the arrival of the brilliant F8 Tributo, 2020 will be the final model year of the 488.

Few experiences can compete with the thrill of driving a V-12 Ferrari, but customers may find themselves considering cars like the Lamborghini Aventador, Aston Martin DBS Superleggera, and Bentley Continental GT.",

McLaren claims that the Senna is the most track-focused car they've ever produced. What this means is a ton of race-inspired engineering has gone into this car, and the numbers do most of the talking: with a curb weight of only 2,897 pounds, the Senna is the lightest vehicle McLaren has built since the legendary F1. Based on the McLaren 720S, it packs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 developing 789 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. At speed, the Senna creates close to a ton of downforce and will reach a top speed of 208 mph. This then is no speed-chasing hypercar, but a true track weapon with the go to match, and rivals the likes of the Ford GT.",
